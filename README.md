# Short Answers (Name TBD)

Project spun up at HackTech 2017 with the goal to create a semi-automated grader that uses text analysis (services provided by Microsoft API) to provide students with instant feedback on their answers to a short answer prompt.

Description:
LITAF (Linguistic Informative Telecommunicational Assessment Feature) allows a master user to create a form and to share it via a custom URL. Students who have this URL are then able to input their own answers and, upon submission, receive an automatic grade. The creator of the form, on the other hand, will be able to access student responses to assign the final grade and view data analytics such as plagiarism percentage and sentiment towards the question (especially if the question requires you to volunteer an opinion). The professor can synthesize this information to improve the quality of questions in the future.


Note: Due to the nature of hackathons and our relatively amateur experience with such events, the code in this project has been rushed and is very "hacky" by nature. Please excuse the mess :)
