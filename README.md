# Short Answers (Name TBD)

Project spun up at HackTech 2017 with the goal to create a semi-automated grader that uses text analysis (services provided by Microsoft API) to provide students with instant feedback on their answers to a short answer prompt.

Note: Due to the nature of hackathons and our relatively amateur experience with such events, the code in this project has been rushed and is very "hacky" by nature. Please excuse the mess :)
